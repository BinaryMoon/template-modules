Add the infrastructure to enable Daryl Koopersmith's modular theme concept.

== Description ==

This is a plugin based implementation of Daryl Koopersmith's modular themes concept and patch 
(<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12877">#12877</a>).  It provides the 
`get_template_module()` function, which allows for the creation of well-architected themes with 
highly reusable code.  For more on the use of this function, read Daryl's series of posts:
